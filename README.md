This is my project "Password manager"

In the project, I implemented a password manager 
for use both via the command line and via graphical 
user interfaces. In development, I used third-party libraries, 
such as: SQLAlchemy, Flask, Mypy. 
In testing, I used the standard tools of the unittest module. 
I will be glad to receive your advice and comments on improving the project.
